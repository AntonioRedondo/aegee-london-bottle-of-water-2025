			If after <a href="https://my.aegee.eu/events/bottle-of-water-25" target="_blank" >applying</a> you have received an acceptance email, congratulations! You have been selected for our event. In order to confirm your attendance just follow the below steps:
		</p>
		<ol class="Mt(0.5vw) Pstart(4vw)--mo">
			<li class="Pt(1vw) Pt(4vw)--mo">
				<span class="b">Pay the participation fee of 170€</span>: you can pay by PayPal, card or bank transfer. Please, <span class="b">make the payment within 4 days</span> from the acceptance email arrival. If we do not receive the payment by then we will release the place to the next applicant. Remember that <span class="b">the fee is not refundable.</span> We are doing this event at a loss. And if we got a participant cancellation last minute the hostel will not refund us.

				<h2 class="Mb(1vw) Mb(2vw)--mo">
					By PayPal or card
				</h2>
				<p class="Mt(0vw) Mb(1vw)">
					We prefer this method as <span class="b">we will receive the money instantaneously and your place will be confirmed immediately</span>. We are charged a fee by PayPal when paying with PayPal or card, so we have to charge a bit more, being the price 176€. <span class="b">You do NOT need a PayPal account to pay by card.</span> Just click the <em>Debit or Credit Card</em> button in the opening tab after pressing <em>Pay Now</em>.

					Unlike by PayPal or card, an international bank transfer will take a few days to arrive to our bank account. We will not be able to confirm your place until we receive the payment. Please note that the charges for the international bank transfer must be covered by you, and we have to receive 170€.
