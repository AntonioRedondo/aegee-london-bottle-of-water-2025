		<ul class="Mt(0.5vw) Pstart(4vw)--mo">
			<li class="Pt(1vw) Pt(4vw)--mo">
				<span class="b">The usual stuff you bring with you in a 4-day international trip</span> to a northern country: passport, phone with charger (and <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B0794T6BNV" target="_blank" >adapter</a> for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AC_power_plugs_and_sockets#BS_1363_(Type_G)" target="_blank">British plugs</a>), coat and confortable shoes. The hostel does NOT provide towels (only if you pay extra for it). Bring your own one.
			</li>
			<li class="Pt(1vw) Pt(4vw)--mo">
				 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visa_policy_of_the_United_Kingdom" target="_blank" >Visa if required</a>. If you need a visa to enter the United Kingdom you can apply for it <a href="https://www.gov.uk/standard-visitor" target="_blank" >here</a>. AEGEE-London can provide you with an invitation letter in case you need one.
			</li>
			<li class="Pt(1vw) Pt(4vw)--mo">
				<span class="b">Money (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pound_sterling" target="_blank" >pounds £</a>)</span>: cards are accepted everywhere (mind the bank fees). Even in some places you can only pay with card. Usually credit cards have cheaper fees to pay in shops abroad than debit cards. But at the same time credit cards are more expensive if you want to withdraw cash from a cash machine abroad. Check card fees with your bank.
			</li>
			<li class="Pt(1vw) Pt(4vw)--mo">
				<span class="b">Mobile SIM card</span>: although it is not compulsory, having Internet on the phone in London will be useful. There is WiFi in the hostel. The mobile provider of your country may already be giving you a good price for mobile internet when travelling to the UK. In case it does not an UK SIM card is a cheap way to get internet on the go. You can find SIM cards for less than £10 in every supermarket, or at the airport. With a £10 allowance you should have enough for 4 days. Alternatively, if your phone is compatible with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESIM" target="_blank" >eSIMs</a> (like iPhones or Google Pixels) you could set up an international internet provider, although usually they are not as cheap as local SIM cards (more info <a href="https://www.moneysavingexpert.com/mobiles/what-is-an-esim" target="_blank" >here</a>).

			<li class="Pt(1vw) Pt(4vw)--mo">
				<span class="b">Student card</span> as you may get discounts in some places.

			<li class="Pt(1vw) Pt(4vw)--mo">
				<span class="b">Typical snacks and drinks from your country</span> for the European Night on Thursday. There won't be any cooking facilities.
