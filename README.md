# AEGEE-London's Bottle of Water 2025: Ye Olde British Binge

[_Bottle of Water 2025: Ye Olde British Binge_](https://www.facebook.com/events/9183380181741488) is a 4-day event organised by [AEGEE-London](https://www.facebook.com/AegeeLondon) from Thursday 15th to Sunday 18th of May 2025 in London, United Kingdom.

[AEGEE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AEGEE) stands for Association des États Généraux des Étudiants de l'Europe and it is known as European Students' Forum in English. It is one of the largest trans-national, interdisciplinary student organisations in Europe. Established in 1985, AEGEE currently has around 6,000 members and 110 local branches (antennae) in university cities across Europe, including Russia, Turkey and the Caucasus, with a European board and head office in Brussels.

AEGEE strives for a democratic, diverse and borderless Europe, which is socially, economically and politically integrated, and values the participation of young people in its construction and development. AEGEE is a secular, non-profit organization, not linked to any political party. All projects and activities are based on voluntarily work of its members. AEGEE empowers students and young people in Europe to take an active role in society by influencing political decision makers, and it creates a space for dialogue and learning opportunities.

In order to speed up the development of this website [aegee-london.eu](http://aegee-london.eu) ([source code](https://github.com/AntonioRedondo/aegee-london.eu)) was used as a starting point.
